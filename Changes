Revision history for XML::XPathEngine

version: 0.09
fix:    namespace processing was a bit dodgy, it's been cleaned up now.
        Tested through XML::Twig::XPath and XML::DOM::XPath
fix:    count did not work (RT #34854), found and patched by 
        Yasuhiro Matsumoto
        http://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=34854
added:  XML::XPathEngine set_strict_namespaces method, which makes 
        namespace processing more standard compliant, and probably often
        more of a pain.
        Tested through XML::Twig::XPath
        Thanks to Timothy Appnel for his input in that matter
added:  XML::XPathEngine findnodes_as_strings method, which returns an
        array of strings (the getValue of the nodes). 
fixed:  findnodes_as_string now returns the empty string if the result
        of the XPath query is a boolean (XML::XPathEngine::Boolean), as
        when querying //@id="foo" for example. This makes the behaviour
        similar to XML::LibXML's.
